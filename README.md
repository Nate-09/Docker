This repository is aimed a being a location for templates for various projects like Docker. My lab environment uses Nginx Proxy Mangager to securely access and run web applications using SSL/TLS communication.

From time to time I'll update and store docker-compose and .env files as boilerplates for the community to use.

* ⚡  Key Note: Two primary expectations when using my boilerplates, is I use them in conjunction with Portainer and Nginx Proxy Manager. I haven't tested directly using docker-compose but I'd expect them to still work provided the variables are all correct.

Feel free to use these should you be stuck or looking for guidance or help.
